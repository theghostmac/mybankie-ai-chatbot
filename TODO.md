To adapt the existing codebase to suit your FinTech application focused on personalized financial advice, you'll need to refine the system, removing irrelevant features and adjusting the model's role and functionality. Here’s how you can proceed step by step:

### 1. **Change the Model's Role and Responsibilities**
You've correctly identified that the model’s role needs to change from a generic chatbot to a personalized AI financial advisor. This involves not just changing the description but also the kind of queries it handles and the responses it generates. The system should focus on providing specific financial advice, managing financial data, and generating insights based on user behavior and financial history.

### Steps to Change the Role:
- **Adjust the prompt setup** in `lib.rs` or wherever you formulate queries to OpenAI. Ensure that the context set up for generating responses is tailored to financial advice.
- **Modify example prompts** to include financial queries, like analyzing expenditures, suggesting savings strategies, or advice on debt management.

### 2. **Remove the CLI Tooling Features**
Since the focus is on integrating the model into a backend system rather than interacting via a CLI, you can remove components that are specifically designed for CLI interactions. This includes:
- **Command line argument parsing** related to CLI operations in `main.rs`. This would involve removing the `clap` library usage that manages CLI inputs and commands.

### Components to Remove or Modify:
- **`PrepareArgs`, `QueryArgs`, and `DownloadArgs`** structures and related logic since these are primarily for CLI operations.
- **Remove the subcommands** under `CliCommand` that are specific to CLI functionalities like preparing data from markdown files or handling downloads, which might not be relevant to your financial advice application.

### 3. **Refocus the Data Handling**
Your application will heavily interact with financial data, so you should adjust how data is handled:
- **Streamline data collection and preprocessing** to focus on financial data rather than generic text processing or handling markdown files.
- **Adjust the database schema** in `schema.rs` to cater to financial entities rather than generic pages and sentences. This might include tables for transactions, user profiles, financial goals, etc.

### Adjustments to Make:
- **Modify the database schema setup** to create tables relevant to storing financial transactions, user financial profiles, and advice logs.
- **Ensure the model can handle and process financial data** effectively, adjusting or removing functions like `split_by_sentences` which are tailored for text processing not directly related to financial advice.

### 4. **Simplify and Secure Data Integration**
Focus on ensuring the data flow between your Golang backend and the Rust model is efficient and secure, considering financial data's sensitivity:
- **Secure API endpoints**: Ensure that the endpoints handling data between your backend and the model are secure, using appropriate authentication and encryption.
- **Efficient data serialization**: Optimize how data is serialized and deserialized between Golang and Rust, focusing on efficiency and minimizing overhead.

### 5. **Update Model Interaction Logic**
Since the model will serve as a financial advisor, its interaction logic should be sophisticated enough to handle nuanced financial queries:
- **Enhance the logic in `Client.completion` and `Client.embeddings`** to handle more complex financial queries, potentially integrating more specialized models or APIs tailored to financial analysis.

### Conclusion
By making these changes, you reorient the application from a generic chatbot to a specialized financial advice tool integrated within your backend system. Each step not only strips away unnecessary features but also enhances the system’s relevance to your specific use case, leveraging AI for personalized financial advice. This tailored approach will help in providing accurate, user-specific advice, thereby adding significant value to your FinTech product.
